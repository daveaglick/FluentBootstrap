# FluentBootstrap
## Overview
FluentBootstrap provides extensions, helper classes, model binding, and other goodies to help you use the Bootstrap CSS framework from .NET code. It enables using Bootstrap (and to some extent, regular HTML elements) in a variety of different ways without having to worry about HTML, CSS, etc. The goal is to have strongly-typed classes, methods, and extensions that cover as much of the Bootstrap library as possible. Support for ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET WebPages is currently provided.
