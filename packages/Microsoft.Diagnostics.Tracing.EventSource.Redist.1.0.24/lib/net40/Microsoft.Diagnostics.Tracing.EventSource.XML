             comparing the current list with a list it cached on the previous invocation.

            This class is meant to be inherited by a user-defined event source in order to define a managed
            ETW provider.
            The minimal definition of an EventSource simply specifies a number of ETW event methods that
            call one of the EventSource.WriteEvent overloads, <see cref="M:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.WriteEventCore(System.Int32,System.Int32,Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.EventData*)"/>, 
            or <see cref="M:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.WriteEventWithRelatedActivityIdCore(System.Int32,System.Guid*,System.Int32,Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.EventData*)"/> to log them. This functionality 
            is sufficient for many users.
            <para>
            To achieve more control over the ETW provider manifest exposed by the event source type, the 
            [<see cref="T:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventAttribute"/>] attributes can be specified for the ETW event methods.
            </para><para>
            For very advanced EventSources, it is possible to intercept the commands being given to the
            eventSource and change what filtering is done (see EventListener.EnableEvents and 
            <see cref="M:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventListener.DisableEvents(Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource)"/>) or cause actions to be performed by the eventSource, 
            e.g. dumping a data structure (see EventSource.SendCommand and
            <see cref="M:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.OnEventCommand(Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventCommandEventArgs)"/>).
            </para><para>
            The eventSources can be turned on with Windows ETW controllers (e.g. logman), immediately. 
            It is also possible to control and intercept the data dispatcher programmatically.  See 
            <see cref="T:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventListener"/> for more.

            An EventListener represents a target for the events generated by EventSources (that is subclasses
            of <see cref="T:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource"/>), in the current appdomain. When a new EventListener is created
            it is logically attached to all eventSources in that appdomain. When the EventListener is Disposed, then
            it is disconnected from the event eventSources. Note that there is a internal list of STRONG references
            to EventListeners, which means that relying on the lack of references to EventListeners to clean up
            EventListeners will NOT work. You must call EventListener.Dispose explicitly when a dispatcher is no
            longer needed.
            <para>
            Once created, EventListeners can enable or disable on a per-eventSource basis using verbosity levels
            (<see cref="T:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventLevel"/>) and bitfields (<see cref="T:Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventKeywords"/>) to further restrict the set of 
            events to be sent to the dispatcher. The dispatcher can also send arbitrary commands to a particular 
            eventSource using the 'SendCommand' method. The meaning of the commands are eventSource specific.
            </para><para>
            The Null Guid (that is (new Guid()) has special meaning as a wildcard for 'all current eventSources in
            the appdomain'. Thus it is relatively easy to turn on all events in the appdomain if desired.
            </para><para>
            It is possible for there to be many EventListener's defined in a single appdomain. Each dispatcher is
            logically independent of the other listeners. Thus when one dispatcher enables or disables events, it
            affects only that dispatcher (other listeners get the events they asked for). It is possible that
            commands sent with 'SendCommand' would do a semantic operation that would affect the other listeners
            (like doing a GC, or flushing data ...), but this is the exception rather than the rule.
            </para><para>
            Thus the model is that each EventSource keeps a list of EventListeners that it is sending events
            to. Associated with each EventSource-dispatcher pair is a set of filtering criteria that determine for
            that eventSource what events that dispatcher will receive.
            </para><para>
            Listeners receive the events on their 'OnEventWritten' method. Thus subclasses of EventListener must
            override this method to do something useful with the data.
            </para><para>
            In addition, when new eventSources are created, the 'OnEventSourceCreate' method is called. The
            invariant associated with this callback is that every eventSource gets exactly one
            'OnEventSourceCreate' call for ever eventSource that can potentially send it log messages. In
            particular when a EventListener is created, typically a series of OnEventSourceCreate' calls are
            made to notify the new dispatcher of all the eventSources that existed before the EventListener was
            created.

            Dispose should be called when the EventListener no longer desires 'OnEvent*' callbacks. Because
            there is an internal list of strong references to all EventListeners, calling 'Dispose' directly
            is the only way to actually make the listen die. Thus it is important that users of EventListener

            This method is called whenever a new eventSource is 'attached' to the dispatcher.
            This can happen for all existing EventSources when the EventListener is created
            as well as for any EventSources that come into existence after the EventListener
            has been created.
            
            These 'catch up' events are called during the construction of the EventListener.
            Subclasses need to be prepared for that.
            
            In a multi-threaded environment, it is possible that 'OnEventWritten' callbacks
            for a particular eventSource to occur BEFORE the OnEventSourceCreated is issued.

            EventSourceIndex is small non-negative integer (suitable for indexing in an array)
            identifying EventSource. It is unique per-appdomain. Some EventListeners might find
            it useful to store additional information about each eventSource connected to it,
            and EventSourceIndex allows this extra information to be efficiently stored in a

            EventSources currently do not pro-actively remove themselves from this list. Instead
            when eventSources's are GCed, the weak handle in this list naturally gets nulled, and
            we will reuse the slot. Today this list never shrinks (but we do reuse entries
            that are in the list). This seems OK since the expectation is that EventSources
            tend to live for the lifetime of the appdomain anyway (they tend to be used in

            EventSources support localization of events. The names used for events, opcodes, tasks, keywords and maps 
            can be localized to several languages if desired. This works by creating a ResX style string table 
            (by simply adding a 'Resource File' to your project). This resource file is given a name e.g. 
            'DefaultNameSpace.ResourceFileName' which can be passed to the ResourceManager constructor to read the 
            resources. This name is the value of the LocalizationResources property. 
            </para><para>
            If LocalizationResources property is non-null, then EventSource will look up the localized strings for events by 
            using the following resource naming scheme

            <para>
            where the capitalized name is the name of the event, task, keyword, or map value that should be localized.
